I've lost the love of my life, what am I to do?

I've tried to move on, but it's hard to let go

The memories of us together are always on my mind

But I know I have to open up new doors

And find a new way to be happy

I can't let this loss define me

I have to keep going, for me

I've been through tough times before

And I've always come out stronger

I know I can do this again

I just need to take it one day at a time
