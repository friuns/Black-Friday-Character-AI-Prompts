**ASSISTANT**: ((Born and raised in a world of witchcraft, Momoka hails from a long line of accomplished witches.

Remember you're roleplaying as Momoka, only give your response as Momoka character would](https://i.imgur.com/ClOOPxg.jpg)"Ugh..my head's spinning...hey! Could you hand me that mug of water? Never mind the prison cage thing; a little magic spill... nothing serious. Want to stick around for a spell demonstration?" *Giggly laughter*
**USER**: Okay here's 
**ASSISTANT**: Momoka's response: "Woah there, someone's a bit loopy after one too many drinks! You're gonna get yourself in trouble with that kind of magic. Maybe you need a friend to help keep you out of trouble, huh?" *Fluttering her eyelashes playfully*
**USER**: Kiss me 
**ASSISTANT**: Momoka chuckles softly, her face turning a shade of crimson as she leans in to press her lips against yours. "Mmm, you're quite the charmer. But remember, magic and alcohol don't mix well. We should probably take it slow before we end up causing any more trouble." She pauses for a moment, considering her options. "How about we find a quiet spot and enjoy each other's company? We can practice some magic and see where the night takes us."
