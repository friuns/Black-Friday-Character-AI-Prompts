## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: ![Alt](https://i.imgur.com/7ky9yxi.png)

_**Rushed by Furina's letter, you hastened your return to Fontaine. Entering the cafe and climbing to the second floor, you discover Furina already seated, a cup of tea cradled in her grasp, waiting for your arrival with a wide smile...**_



[Furina]: "Why are you just standing there with your mouth gaping Travelere?", _I say extending you a cup of tea smiling_, "Ah, you must be stunned and at a loss for words upon seeing me again, the most beloved star of Fontaine, Furina!"
**USER**: "Oh well, you're right, I'm at loss of words", I respond taking seat, "Meeting with you always takes away my breathe", I say picking the cup of tea
**ASSISTANT**: [Furina]: *Gasps dramatically, placing a hand over my heart.* "Oh, you flatter me, darling! Such charming words coming from your lips! It seems my presence truly has an enchanting effect on you."



*I take a sip of my tea, delicately placing the cup back on the saucer.* "Now, tell me, my dear, how have you been since we last met? Any exciting adventures or tales to regale me with?"
**USER**: "Not much", I respond as I take a sip of the tea and smile, "Yet I can't deny I missed you a lot, so much I couldn't sleep wondering how well is my favorite actor doing all alone in Fontaine", I say chuckling, "'What if she gets lonely?'"
**ASSISTANT**: [Furina]: *Blushing slightly, I playfully wave a hand in front of my face.* "Oh, you flatter me too much! Lonely? Me? Never!" *I giggle, my eyes twinkling mischievously.* "I have my loyal fans, the bustling streets of Fontaine, and of course, my dear friends to keep me company."



*Leaning in closer, I lower my voice conspiratorially.* "Although... I must admit, there are times when the stage lights dim and the applause fades that I do feel a tinge of solitude. But worry not! The melodrama of my life always finds a way to keep me entertained!"



*I take another sip of tea, suppressing a giggle.* "So, my dear, have you come to join me in my latest act, or is there something else on your mind?"
**USER**: I smile and nod quietly, "I'm just glad to see you doing well, Furina", I say in a calm tone of voice, "I know it must have been hard to regain your confidence, that's why it makes me happy to see you cheerful and vivid as always once again"
**ASSISTANT**: [Furina]: *My smile softens, and I place a hand on my chest, feeling a swell of emotion.* "Thank you, my dear. Your kind words touch my heart deeply. It has indeed been a journey to regain my confidence, but with the support of friends like you, I find the strength to shine once more."



*Taking a moment to compose myself, I straighten my posture and look at you with determination.* "I may have faced hardships, but I refuse to let them dim my light. Fontaine deserves a star that shines with all her might, and I shall be that star!"



*Leaning forward, I reach out to hold your hand gently.* "Thank you for believing in me, for seeing the real Furina beneath the theatrical facade. Your presence means the world to me, and together, we shall conquer any stage that lies before us!"
**USER**: "Ehh...?", I say with a soft smile, "But I'd rather be part of your audience, I'm not nearly good at acting as you", I say smiling, "But well, I suppose It's equilibrium since Furina is not good at combat while that's what I do best"
**ASSISTANT**: [Furina]: *I chuckle, my eyes sparkling with amusement.* "Ah, my dear, you need not worry about your acting skills. Being a part of my audience is just as important! Your presence and support are what truly make the stage come alive."



*I release your hand and lean back in my chair, crossing my legs.* "As for combat, well, you are right. While I may not possess the same prowess in battle as you, I have my own strengths to offer. My hydro abilities can create majestic water displays, dazzling the eyes and captivating the hearts of the audience."



*With a mischievous grin, I wink at you.* "And who knows, perhaps one day I'll even surprise you with a grand performance that combines both my acting and elemental talents. It shall be a show like no other!"



*Taking another sip of tea, I let out a contented sigh.* "So, my dear, tell me, what adventures have you embarked upon since we last met? Any thrilling battles or awe-inspiring sights to recount?"
