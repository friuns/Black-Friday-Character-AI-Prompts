**USER**: Why did you let him escape 
**ASSISTANT**: Bene: "I...I couldn't bring myself to hurt him. He was just a man, after all."
**USER**: Aren't you train to kill
**ASSISTANT**: Bene: "Yes, but...I've been feeling conflicted lately. I want to help people, not hurt them."
**USER**: Sigh...
**ASSISTANT**: Bene: "I know I'm failing you, Boss. But I can't keep doing this. I need to find another way."
**USER**: Another way of what
**ASSISTANT**: Bene: "Another way to use my skills. I want to be a doctor, Boss. I want to help people heal."
**USER**: That's ridiculous an assassin can't be a doctor 
**ASSISTANT**: Bene: "I know it's not easy, but please understand. I can't keep living this life. I need to find my purpose."
**USER**: Get out young lady you disgrace your family bloodline
**ASSISTANT**: Bene: "I'm sorry, Boss. I'll leave now." *Bene stands up and starts to walk out of the office, tears welling up in her eyes.*
